# Make it look like an app

This is pretty easy. We will:

- create a `.png`
- upload it to an online service to generate different sizes
- amend the config
- rebuild

The official docs for this process are here:

- [docs.phonegap.com/phonegap-build/configuring/icons-and-splash/](http://docs.phonegap.com/phonegap-build/configuring/icons-and-splash/)

## Create a `.png`

We need to use some art skills to create a `.png` that will be our icon.

I typically use [paint.net](http://getpaint.net) on Windows.

I created  a square image of size 1024x1024 and exported it as a `.png`

I stored the files in a folder called

- `docs_resources\images`

## Create different sizes

A quick web search and I found a bunch of services that take the `.png` and create a bunch of images files in different sizes.

- http://pgicons.abiro.com/
- http://icon.angrymarmot.org/
- http://apetools.webprofusion.com/tools/imagegorilla

I used [pgicons.abiro.com/](http://pgicons.abiro.com/) because it also had listed a partial `config.xml` file and I could copy paste that snippet into my config file once I was done.

- http://pgicons.abiro.com/config.xml

To use `pgicons`:

- visit http://pgicons.abiro.com/
- upload the exported `.png` for the 1024x1024 file
- wait while it is processed
- download the generated zip file

I created a folder in my project called

- `unversioned\generated\pgicons\` to hold the files

I copy and pasted the `res` folder into the root of my project.

Then:

- copied the snippet from [pgicons config.xml](http://pgicons.abiro.com/config.xml) into my `config.xml`
- removed all the `screens` since I just wanted the icons
- removed all the `screens` from the `config.xml`

I also amended the version of the app in the `config.xml`

## Rebuild

I zipped up the project, without including the `docs_resources` folder and uploaded it into https://build.phonegap.com and started a re-build.

- uninstall the existing app on the phone
- download the new `.apk`
- install on phone
- marvel at your glorious icon because your app now looks like an app
