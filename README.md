# The Evil Tester Sloganizer PhoneGap App

This is a phonegap version of The Evil Tester Sloganizer:

- http://www.eviltester.com/apps/sloganizer.html
- https://github.com/eviltester/sloganizer

Current version is pretty much the web version but I removed the twitter links and book advert so it is just a button that generates a slogan and creates a history of all slogans you've generated for this session.

I used build.phonegap.com to create the app:

First version was built from a zip file.
